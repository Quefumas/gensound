## Contributing

Welcome to Gensound!

You are invited to use the Discussions and/or Issues page to share your experience using Gensound,
ask for help, offer ideas or report bugs.
It would also be cool to see what stuff you come up with, so feel free to share just for fun.

If you want to participate in the development, the Issues page may have some pointers for places that need work.
Feel free to ask there for clarifications, as I will do my best to be available and help find the best approach.
However, take note that I work very hard to maintain high standards for the code in this library
and for the interface with the user.
This means that even simple pull request may be met with quite a lot of high-level discussion and stylistic corrections,
so I hope you will not be discouraged.
Also, it might happen that I'll hesitate to accept even perfectly implemented solutions,
instead waiting for some time until I feel confident that this approach is the right way going forward.
Whatever happens, know that your input and opinion is nevertheless appreciated
and constitutes an important contribution to the development process.
