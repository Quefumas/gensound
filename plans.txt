================ CORE ======================

large-scale future goals:
* make available a host of adjustable Filters and EQs
* make them parametric as well
* CF? or negative shift?
* better support for FM synthesis, also other kinds of synthesis
* simulate guitar amps, distortion and other effects
* upsample/downsample
* interfacing improved playback options
? better musical logic support for intonations and melodies
? drum patterns

fundamental improvements to do:

V find syntax for upsampling/slowing down/ etc.
V find how to put a signal after another signal
V and to repeat signals
V make signals/trnasforms empty skeletons
    so that one may reuse them, or define their own to be reused
    (make sure they store no audio data! apart from RAW)
* keep track of all dangerous floats (when converting from time to samples)
  perhaps maintain a convention that time is in floats, samples in ints
  (that would mean that to slice samples we need to fill in the channels,
  otherwise it will infer wrongly)
no doubt we still need direct After function; putting signals in arrays is not always appropriate
perhaps we should use + as after and & as mix?

next stages:
V curves controlling Gain, Amplitude
* AmpFreq(?), Fade(?), then go over all other transforms
V fix curve discontinuity
V finish panning

V parametrization
V controlled glissandos
V tracks stuff
V fix panning
V ADSR
* TODO fix streak
* pan stereo (we can do a specialized transform for this, using a MultiCurve
  for opening angle and general angle, but is this actually more convenient?
  isn't doing it manually more natural?)
V supply one example of custom panning scheme
* Signal as Curve?
* crossfades

* negative shifts?

V user-defined curves
V user-defined panning schemes [futuristic tho]!!!!

* crossfade for concat???
Sine() | CF | Triangle() ???


sample where MyReverb = Reverb(dry=0.4, time=3)... etc

V TODO: test why squares get negative all the time
* TODO: Audio.mixdown vs. Signal.mixdown.
  Probably should change name of Audio.mixdown - it's just a preparation
  for output of the already-mixed data. possibly should not even be called
  by Signal.mixdown.
V TODO enable concating signal to 0 (supported already?), or to empty Signal()?
enforce "no such thing as seconds" rule! but remember that frequency is measured in Hz...

= Paramterization TODOs:
V Panning
V some problems when concatting two together
* merge with Signal
* for signal have duration irrelevant when frequency is a curve (since it has duration already)
* instead of flatten use __float??

= curves continuing to infinity issues:
* for frequency, that would mean the signal duration can be specified to be
    more than frequency duration. if that is done, we'd expect the signal
    to stop early as well if the duration is shorter than the curve
* or, for frequency have the duration setting ignored; if you want the pitch
    to keep going, add Constant() at the end of the curve.
    in glissando madrigal settings that makes more sense.
* for amplitude/gain/fade/pan envelope, these are transforms and not signals!
    so we expect the curve to affect only the transform, but then stay at
    the place it stopped.

* to consider: 
    SineCurve(frequency=6, depth=3, baseline=330, duration=5e3) | Constant(...)
    may cause problems due to sine not completing whole cycle
    we do not want to force user to compute this, what could be better is 
    SineCurve(frequency=6, depth=3, baseline=330, duration=5e3) | CF | Constant(...)
    i.e. design a kind of cross-fade that makes these continuous
    #####* or (better?) solution: use a Curve instead of 

- Curve*Signal interpreted as Amplitude*Signal? [i.e. replacing float]

* s = WAV(african)[5e3:10e3] takes different parts of african according
  to the sample rate given when realising. bug or feature?
* s = WAV(african)[15e3:25e3:2] works as expected. bug or feature?

? make number of eventual channels seep up to master signal?
  or conclude it by examining the tree? just so we can iterate over channels and do sums?
  
? if signal has 2 subscripts and the 2nd [time] is in ints - maybe have it refer to samples
  instead of time. this allows for more surgical placement of new signals.
  is this possible? or wanted?
  otoh, keep in mind that we can't actually change value of single samples via Signal
  and maybe it should stay that way (though we can replace it with a signal of our choosing or mute it)



=============== Syntactical stuff =============

====== Negative Shifts and CF ======
* Shifted signals when mixed down should perhaps not be fully generated on their own
  with the padded zeros; but rather placed into the mix properly, to save the memory
  allocation of the padding.
* negative shifted signals when concatted should coincide into the previous signal:
  s = Sine(duration=3e3) | Square(duration=3e3)*Shift(-1e3)
  if this goes back beyond the beginning of the signal, the entire mixdown
  should be considered Shifted backwards
* and the shifted property, should all Signals be allowed to have it?
  can be it always safely ignored, except when realising Sequences? and Mixes?
  also it must be conveyed to whatever Signal you're being transformed/mixed into
* when using Sequence, have keyworded argument for BiTransform to be applied
  in the middle (automatic overlap or automatic CF)
* define class TransformChain which is array of transforms, we may multiply it
  by Transforms, adding them to the list.
  when a signal is multiplied by it, it breaks down and the transforms in the chain
  are added individually.
* define class BiTransform which accepts two Transforms/TransformChains, L and R
  and may be concated on both sides to Signals only.
* upon concat Signal | BiTransform, the L transform chain is applied to Signal,
  and the last item in the sequence contains the TransformChain R
* if BiTransform is right-concatted with Signal (by the above points this
  should have been illegal, as it would have been first left-concatted into
  a Signal and dissolved within it), it can also default to disppearing,
  or alternatively ignoring L part. The only advantage for this is the syntactical
  ease when concatting via for loop, so we may prepend each concatted signal
  by a CF, even though we start empty.
* when concatting Signal into Sequence, check to see if the last item
  on the list is a TransformChain. if so, replace it by the concatted Signal
  times that transform chain.
* alternative implementation: leave the BiTransform as an item in Sequence,
  and only upon realise() apply the transforms. pbbly better to stop in the middle
  and break the BiTransform down, so that realise would only be called once
  for each signal in Sequence.
  the only advantage here is that when pretty-printing the signal tree,
  we get to see the BiTransform.
* how about more complex BiTransforms? that actually let both signals interact?
  that would mean that on Sequence.realise() we would have to *look ahead*
  before realising, or perhaps realise the first, then upon bumping into
  the BiTrans we would skip it, realise whatever's afterwards, then come back
  and apply L,R to these results AND let BiTrans concat on its own.
  and this coould cause problems if the R signal has yet another bitransform
  afterwards. i think we leave this for user custom designs.


-===- Panning -===-
(pan law should be class variable for Pan, so we can set it once)

use cases:
V take mono signal and pan it into several channels
V apply amplitude on individual channels (this is covered already no?)
V take stereo signal and make it span the space differently
    relatively easy to derive from the 1st note above

mono -> multiple - how do we do it?
V provide n curves to indicate particular gains/levels
  but note that we can just expand mono to multi then apply individual envelops
V pre-define a mapping R -> R^n, and then just give one function t->R


suppose listener in middle of triangle, we can use complex number to give exact source of sound
    to_channels = lambda x: ()
does it mean we need to enable 2d curves??? or just combining them
it would be easier to use polar coordinates instead of complex numbers tho

# what happens if i do s[0]*=Pan()? how many channels do  i end up with??
the above has undefined behavior and throws an error - for good reason.

-===- Transforms --
use '.' to apply transforms?
Sine().Pan().Gain().Shift() + ...
In that case can't use amplitude as float


* stereo.L ? # overriding set/getattr is a messy, will doo later

* taking stereo signal and panning it in stereo (i.e. make it take up -100L to -10L)
    new_stereo = stereo*Pan(panLaw=default, panL, panR)

preferably have as many of these done by syntax as possible.

=-=== parametrization syntax =====

things that would be paramterized:
* Dbs/amplitudes
* EQ data
* Pan
* frequency or phase (integral of frequency)

* define Curve.__call__? makes it easier to define panning schemes

here the object is functions of time (also of channels??)

# perhaps make Signal inherit from "Time-dependent" class, which is also used for time params

or we can define as checkpoints:
pan = line((0,0), (50,1e3), (50,3e3), (100,5e3))

* another possibility:
    curve = 1e3*const(5) | 5e3*line(220,440)
    (though this would go against mergin signals and curves)

* cumulative vs. absolute time durations - important considerations
* also need to do last value continuing to infinity.
  but that would make duration not clear.
  (wait: this depends on whether the param is freq or amplitude)
  may be better (i,e for envelopes) to have the duration of the note specified,
  and the curve only applying for its own duration.
  i.e. note of 6 secs, with the envelope applying for 100ms
* to allow integration we may also let predefined curves supply their own integral
behaves like an iterator/iterable?

-------- Summary of operators to support nicely:

& mix
+ concat
* apply transform
** repeat !!!
* scalar? amplitude

t = s[:,3e3:5e3]
s[:, 3e3:5e3] *= Reverse()

| float (concat with silence of float duration)
+ float (add DC/constant of amount float)

what about order of operations?
do we want concat or mix first?

=-====
perhaps supply a length-of operator?
wav = (x:=Sine()) + Square().Shift(duration=x.length())

* also, we may want after in conjunction with [negative] shift.
* do we want before?




important: can transforms extend the signal on their own?
there is the transform EXtend which does so.
sliced transforms need to be careful not to move stuff around when they do
artifical extensions (i.e. reverb etc)

important: are transforms powerful enough to do flexible reverbs?
i guess they can do so by direct manipulation on audio,
but it also seems natural to implement transforms by 

=================Other stuff =======================

- functions scheduled for examination:
    - signal.realise
    - amplitude.realise

- once we solve the big ones above, probably the next stage is having a full-fledged
EQ and Compressor.


V perhaps have transforms multipliable by each other to create chains,
which can then be added in bulk to a signal.
 the purpose is that the user can employ any order of multiplications to get
the desired result
for that we may need transforms to copy themselves on apply



- if num_channels, sample rate etc. are needed during signal realisation,
we can perrhaps pass a param dictionary instead. if we can deal
with only sample rate, thats good too.



perhaps ensure that all signals ARE empty shells
otherwise we cannot construct a signal for reuse


===================== SIGNALS ====================

subclass of Raw that stores the buffer of a mixed-down Audio!
this is also great for incremental composition, you can put aside previous results

implement len() of signals

compare between signals using length?

let users supply phase function instead of frequency function,
to allow them to spare the manual integration.

perhaps have all signals store their audio in a cache, since transformed
signales may well be used multiple times

class Majchord(Mix):
    def __init__(self, base_freq, sig, duration):
        self.signals = [sig(frequency=base_freq, duration=duration),
                        sig(frequency=base_freq*semi(4), duration=duration)]
                        ...

also easier representations of melody,
i.e. give semitones and signal type, durations,
and it automatically gnerates a Sequence

=================== TRANSFORMS ===================

- cut and delete middle of signal

- do transforms *between* signals, i.e. binary transforms.
  for example: crossfade, or slice something from the middle
  for this we can perhaps implement the same concat syntax:
  Signal | Binary-transform | Signal.

implement __eq__? to see if class and arguments are the same

force quantize? suppose i have byte width 2 but want only 1000 levels of amplitude

Transform: Right/Left
changes to Stereo and puts in appropriate plae
Also:
Stereo(pan = [-1,1])

* mute according to pattern
* add extend


perhaps allow multiplication by float vector,, one per channel

for multiple channels - enable user defined directions!
not necessarily linear, can be used to compose for strangely placed 3d speakers


have a pan transform that allows for a single function that defines direction,
with the addition of a power law


downsample/upsample



allow negative shifts? (which can cancel previous positive shifts,
or lose the beginning of the audio)

experiment: reverse compress.
high amps get lowered down, low amps get powered up


possibly faster reverb:
for i, s in enumerate(audio.audio):
    audio.audio[i] += temp
    temp *= 0.2
    temp += audio.audio[i]


============== enhanced transforms/effect =====
now that we have apply encapsulated by realise,
perhaps we can create a new Superclass of transforms,
which upon realise actually receieves the relevant
Signal (not audio), does actual shit to it and then generates()!


================== ANALYZE =======================

DC balance - analyse and correct


implement in analyze.py a function to test frequency response of transforms
by applying them to the impulse and then computing DFT magniuteds


for continuous DFT:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform

================= OTHER CAPABILITIES =============
interface with MIDI!

allow realtime interactions

look at Audacity list of effects (and source code) for more transform ideas

================ DEBUG & STABILITY ===========================
- Audio.__add__ should not affect audio.
perhaps implement iadd instead.

- Audio.conform should not return anything

- when mixdown takes more than a few seconds, print a record of how long it took
(preferably to the log as well)

ensure that signals and transforms are applid according to the same order
note that this may be annoying when using __radd__ etc


summarize all places where floating number convert to int
so the user knows exactly all the places of possible inaccuracy






TODO
apparently it really doesn't copy:
ones = lambda n: tuple([1.0 for x in range(n)])
    w = WAV(filename)
    wav = sum([(1-8/10)*w*Shift(duration=100*x)*Average_samples(weights=ones(2*x+1)) for x in range(5)])
    #wav += 
    
    audio = wav.mixdown(sample_rate=44100, byte_width=2)
    play_Audio(audio, is_wait=True)
this downsamples!

the problem actgually is not in copying the audio; its the fact
that multiplying signals with transforms changes the original signal
its the signal that may need to be copied anew
perhaps just use audio cache is better


============== ????? =============

np view vs. copy
http://www.jessicayung.com/numpy-views-vs-copies-avoiding-costly-mistakes/
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4370745/view-onto-a-numpy-array

perhaps define "10s" to be interpreted as 10*1000

alias "sum" as "mix"

for export_test, get the actual code of the calling function,
and store it as metadata to the WAV!

come back to sound synthesis book one day


add frequency/pitch class calculus
as well as time measurement calculus (add beat, add 1/16, add 1/3 etc)
which can be realised at generate-time according to selected tempo

musical functionality to pick random note from distribution
distributions can be midi ranges, scales, whatever

connect to VSTs to use inside the code!


dB = 20 * log10(amplitude)



amplitude = 14731 / 32767
          = 0.44

dB = 20 * log10(0.44)
   = -7.13
