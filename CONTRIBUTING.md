## Contributing

This project welcomes contribution.
Here are some suggestions:

* If you've used this code and have some constructive feedback,
we would love to hear it.
* If you've done something cool with this code or it helped you in some way,
letting us know would fuel our motivation.
* QAing various parts of the code (especially the syntax features) and reporting bugs.
* Suggesting improvements to the code structure.
* Helping with some of the known issues scattered in the code TODOs and in the issues list.

Also, please keep in mind that to maintain the "intuitive, flexible and lightweight"
profile of this code, any modifications to the code will be examined quite closely,
and will be accepted only when we are sufficiently confident that it will serve
these purposes in the long run.
That may mean that acceptance even of obvious features that are trivial to implement
may be delayed until the implementation feels right
(point in case, development of this code once halted for several months just
because I couldn't make up my mind as to what would be the best operator
to represent concatenation; but I hope that such a case won't repeat itself).
